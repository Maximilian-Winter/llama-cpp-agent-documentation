### Structured Output
This example shows how to get structured output objects using the StructureOutputAgent class.
```python copy
# Example agent that uses the StructuredOutputAgent class to create a dataset entry of a book out of unstructured data.

from enum import Enum

from llama_cpp import Llama
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from llama_cpp_agent.structured_output_agent import StructuredOutputAgent


# Example enum for our output model
class Category(Enum):
    Fiction = "Fiction"
    NonFiction = "Non-Fiction"


# Example output model
class Book(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents an entry about a book.
    """
    title: str = Field(..., description="Title of the book.")
    author: str = Field(..., description="Author of the book.")
    published_year: int = Field(..., description="Publishing year of the book.")
    keywords: list[str] = Field(..., description="A list of keywords.")
    category: Category = Field(..., description="Category of the book.")
    summary: str = Field(..., description="Summary of the book.")
